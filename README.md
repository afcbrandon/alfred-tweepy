# Alfred4 Tweet
an Alfred4 workflow that uses the [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/) library to quickly send a tweet

make sure that Tweepy is installed.

the simplest way to do that is with the following code in your terminal.

    pip install git+https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy.git

-   [](https://github.com/ "GitHub")

you will also need some twitter developer keys. 
you can get them from here [https://developer.twitter.com/](https://developer.twitter.com/)

once you have your keys, open up the python script in the workflow and add them.

Now configure a hotkey for example mine is ‚å•T
that then fires the work flow and all you have to do is type out your tweet.
